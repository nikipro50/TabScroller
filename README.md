# TabScroller

**TabScroller** is a lightweight, client-side Fabric mod designed to improve the Minecraft tab list experience on crowded servers.

When a server has many players online, the vanilla tab list only shows a limited number of entries, often hiding players with lower priority. TabScroller solves this problem by introducing **tab list pagination**, allowing you to scroll through all online players easily.
